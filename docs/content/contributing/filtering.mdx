### Branch diff

By default commitsar will run git log on the base branch and the branch which is going to get merged and gets a diff of the commit objects.
This allows us to get commits only on the branch iregardless of what was merged from master.

### Filtering by type

In the above example when running commitsar on master or the branch the commit `merge branch feat/docs into master` and `merge master into branch` will get filtered out.
This is to prevent commitsar checking the default merge commits which are not going to be conventional commit compliant.

title: Worker pipelines

Commitsar uses pipelines in order to use as much CPU power as possible. These are based on number of CPU \* 2 (assuming 1 physical and 1 logical core available). In order to add a new pipeline
you just need to build a pipeline that adheres to the types provided here: https://github.com/aevea/commitsar/blob/master/internal/dispatcher/pipeline.go and register it in the root_runner.
Each pipeline returns either a success type or pushes errors into the error channel.

At the end all of this is collected and the results are presented to the user.

This will also be used to introduce an easy plugin system in the future.
